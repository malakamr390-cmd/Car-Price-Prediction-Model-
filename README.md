# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗📊
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end predictive analytics pipeline designed to **estimate car prices** based on multiple factors, including **year, make & model, mileage, accident history, damages, color, and other specifications**. It combines **data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and visualization** to provide actionable insights for pricing, inventory valuation, and sales strategy.

# Features & Methodology
## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Handled missing data using **mode imputation** and other techniques.
- Created new features such as **car age, mileage per year, accident severity score, and color popularity index.**
- Encoded categorical variables (make, model, color) using **one-hot encoding** for modeling.
## Modeling Approaches

- **Regression models** to predict continuous car prices.
- **Random Forest Classifier** to categorize cars into price ranges (low, medium, high).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for similarity-based predictions and validation.
## Evaluation

- Evaluated models using metrics such as **RMSE, MAE, and classification accuracy.**
- Feature importance analysis highlighted **mileage, year, and accident history** as top predictors.
## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
## Results & Impact
- Built predictive models that accurately estimate car prices for resale or auction.
- Enabled stakeholders to make **data-driven pricing decisions**, optimize inventory valuation, and improve sales strategy.
- Identified key price drivers to support business and operational decision-making.
